# 🚀 Design Patterns in Multiple Languages

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides implementations of **various design patterns** in multiple programming languages, including:

- 🐍 Python
- 🦜 TypeScript
- 🐹 Go (Golang)

Design patterns help in writing **scalable, maintainable, and reusable** code by following industry best practices. This repo aims to provide **clear, well-documented** implementations of patterns across different languages.

---

## 🏗 **Implemented Patterns**

The repository is categorized into **three main types** of design patterns:

### 🔹 **Creational Patterns**

These patterns deal with **object creation mechanisms** to increase flexibility and reuse.

- ✅ **Singleton** – Ensures only one instance of a class exists.
- ✅ **Factory Method** – Creates objects via factory functions.
- ✅ **Abstract Factory** – Encapsulates multiple factories.
- ⏳ **Builder** – Constructs objects step-by-step.
- ⏳ **Prototype** – Creates new objects by copying existing ones.

### 🔹 **Structural Patterns**

These patterns focus on **object composition and relationships**.

- ✅ **Adapter** – Bridges two incompatible interfaces.
- ✅ **Decorator** – Dynamically adds behaviors to objects.
- ⏳ **Facade** – Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- ⏳ **Proxy** – Controls access to another object.
- ⏳ **Composite** – Structures objects into tree hierarchies.

### 🔹 **Behavioral Patterns**

These patterns define **communication and interaction** between objects.

- ✅ **Observer** – Defines a subscription model for updates.
- ✅ **Strategy** – Encapsulates algorithms into interchangeable modules.
- ⏳ **Command** – Encapsulates commands as objects.
- ⏳ **State** – Allows an object to alter behavior based on internal state.
- ⏳ **Mediator** – Handles complex object interactions.
