# 🚀 Design Patterns in Multiple Languages

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides implementations of **various design patterns** in multiple programming languages, including:

- 🐍 Python
- 🦜 TypeScript
- 🐹 Go (Golang)

Design patterns help in writing **scalable, maintainable, and reusable** code by following industry best practices. This repo aims to provide **clear, well-documented** implementations of patterns across different languages.

## 🏗 **Implemented Patterns**

The repository is categorized into **three main types** of design patterns:

### 🔹 **Creational Patterns**

These patterns deal with **object creation mechanisms** to increase flexibility and reuse.

- [x] **Singleton** (Ensures only one instance of a class exists)
- [x] **Factory Method** (Creates objects via factory functions)
- [x] **Abstract Factory** (Encapsulates multiple factories)
- [ ] **Builder** (Constructs objects step-by-step)
- [ ] **Prototype** (Creates new objects by copying existing ones)

### 🔹 **Structural Patterns**

These patterns focus on **object composition and relationships**.

- [x] **Adapter** (Bridges two incompatible interfaces)
- [x] **Decorator** (Dynamically adds behaviors to objects)
- [ ] **Facade** (Provides a simplified interface to a complex system)
- [ ] **Proxy** (Controls access to another object)
- [ ] **Composite** (Structures objects into tree hierarchies)

### 🔹 **Behavioral Patterns**

These patterns define **communication and interaction** between objects.

- [x] **Observer** (Defines a subscription model for updates)
- [x] **Strategy** (Encapsulates algorithms into interchangeable modules)
- [ ] **Command** (Encapsulates commands as objects)
- [ ] **State** (Allows an object to alter behavior based on internal state)
- [ ] **Mediator** (Handles complex object interactions)

## 🛠 **Installation & Usage**

To test any pattern in your preferred language:

### **Python**

```sh
cd creational/singleton/python
python3 singleton.py
```
````

### **TypeScript**

```sh
cd creational/singleton/typescript
tsc singleton.ts && node singleton.js
```

### **Go**

```sh
cd creational/singleton/go
go run singleton.go
```
